      <description>Explored the NIPS Papers data, to determine what type of data it is and how it is structured Prepared the data by removing all the columns that do not contain useful text information Visualized the number of publications per year, to understand the extent of the machine learning &amp;lsquo;revolution&amp;rsquo;! Modified the text data by applying regular expression to remove any punctuation in the title to make it more amenable for analysis Created a word cloud of the titles of the research papers using Andreas Muellerâ€™s word cloud library.</description>

      <description>Loaded and Viewed the confidential dataset, as the contributor of the dataset has anonymized the feature names Read this blog, to better understand the anonymized features Handled all missing values, as they affect the performance of machine learning model if they go unchanged Preprocessed the data into Three main tasks: Converted the non-numeric data into numeric, Splitting the data into train and test sets, and Scaled the feature values to a uniform range Fitted a Logistic Regression model (a generalized linear model), and Evaluated the model on the test set with respect to classification accuracy, and summarized the performance of a classification algorithm using Confusion matrix Performed GridSearchCV by defining the grid of values to two hyperparameters &amp;lsquo;tol&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;max_iter&amp;rsquo; to improve the model&amp;rsquo;s ability to predict credit card approvals Summarized the best achieved model score of 85% and the respective best parameters  Link to GitHub Repository</description>
