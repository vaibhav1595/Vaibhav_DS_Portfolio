      <description>This project is a series of projects that walk through working with image data, building classifiers using traditional techniques, and leveraging the power of deep learning for computer vision.
  Image Loading and Processing - This project is the FIRST part of a series of projects, in this I will use the Python image library Pillow to load and manipulate image data.
  Predict Species from Images - This project is the SECOND part of a series of projects, in this I will then build a model to identify honey bees and bumble bees given an image of these insects.</description>

      <description>Checked Target Incidence using a Binary classifier Model which provides the output in &amp;lsquo;0 - the donor will not give blood&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;1 - the donor will give blood&amp;rsquo;. Result is [&amp;lsquo;0&amp;rsquo; - 0.762] &amp;amp; [&amp;lsquo;1&amp;rsquo; - 0.238] Zeroed into LogisticRegression model using TPOT, a Python Automated Machine Learning tool that optimizes machine learning pipelines using genetic programming, giving us the AUC score of 0.7850 Improved the AUC score by 0.</description>

      <description>Loaded corpus of tweets from November 2017 into Pandas DataFrame, and passed it to scikit-learn for further processing Created vectorized representations of the tweets using &amp;lsquo;CountVectorizer&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;TfidfVectorizer&amp;rsquo; classes in order to apply machine learning after splitting the data into test and training sets Trained Multinomial Naive Bayes model with both the CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer data to check which model will perform better. Results are TF-IDF model performs better with 0.</description>

      <description>Explored the NIPS Papers data, to determine what type of data it is and how it is structured Prepared the data by removing all the columns that do not contain useful text information Visualized the number of publications per year, to understand the extent of the machine learning &amp;lsquo;revolution&amp;rsquo;! Modified the text data by applying regular expression to remove any punctuation in the title to make it more amenable for analysis Created a word cloud of the titles of the research papers using Andreas Mueller’s word cloud library.</description>
