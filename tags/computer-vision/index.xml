      <description>This project is a series of projects that walk through working with image data, building classifiers using traditional techniques, and leveraging the power of deep learning for computer vision.
  Image Loading and Processing - This project is the FIRST part of a series of projects, in this I will use the Python image library Pillow to load and manipulate image data.
  Predict Species from Images - This project is the SECOND part of a series of projects, in this I will then build a model to identify honey bees and bumble bees given an image of these insects.</description>
